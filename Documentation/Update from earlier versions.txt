Upgrade notes from version 2.0

Version 2.1.  General update to add bridge capability.  This adds a "bridge" device. Through the bridge, you can monitor the status of the Node.js applications and also RESTART the bridge.

Version 2.2. Integrated the parameter "ignore_default" into the commands.  Allows sending of on along with other parameters, reducing number of commands sent.

Version 2.3. Fixed problem with Alexa Voice Command changes.  These changed to provide brightnes with decimals (i.e., 10.1 versus integer 10).

Version 3.0.  Numerous improvements and additions.
a.	Added HS110 energy monitor support (HS110 only)
b.	Changed communications protocol from TCP to UDP.
c.	Added 'waiting' state that displays on "on/off" whenever any function (except HS110 "refresh stats') is selected until the response is received from the device.
